List the components of hadoop2.X and explain each component in detail.

The major components of hadoop 2.x are
1.HDFS
2.MapReduce
3.YARN

*All the master and slave nodes contains both the MapReduce and HDFS components.
*Each master nodes has two components namely  
                                           1.Resource Manager or MapReduce v2
                                           2.HDFS
*HDFS consists of core component called as NameNode which is used to store the metadata.
*In version 2, some of the nodes acts as Master nodes and each of this has 3 main components such as
                                           1.Node Manager
                                           2.Application Manager
                                           3.Data Node
*Each of these master nodes contains one or more slave nodes.
*These slave nodes consists of two components such as 
                                            1.Node Manager
                                            2.HDFS
*Data Node is used to store actual data of big Data application. These nodes does not contain Application Master component.

Resource Manager:
   *It is per-cluster component.
   *It consists of two components such as 
                                             1.Scheduler- It is responsible to schedule the required resources to the applications.
                                             2.Application Manager
Application Master:
   *It is per-application level component.
   *Responsible for managing assigned Application life cycle.
   *Interacts with both resource manager's scheduler and node manager.

Node Manager:
   *It is a per-node level component.
   *Responsible for managing the life cycle of the container and also monitoring each conatiner's resource utilization.

Container:
   *Each of the master or slave nodes contains set of conatiners.
   *It is a portion of memory in HDFS.
   *It is similar to Data slots in Hadoop 1.x.
